#  Job Search App in Sinatra

This small application uses WebScrapper with Mechanize Gem for scrapping through the Indeed.com search results by keywords, dates, city name, company name. Then mashes it up with company review data from Glassdoor.com (ie. Glassdor's company rating, prospects, culture and other users' votes).Ã‚

Also, by using Free Geo IP (which returns a JSON object with your location by the IP address you send the data request from), it automatically fills in city name if you do not specify yours.
